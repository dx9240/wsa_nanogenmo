This code uses Markovify to generate a mashup style novel. it reads all the input files in a directory, and trains Markovify on their content. Sentences are generated along with numbered chapter headings (ex. 'Chapter 15').

The code produces a text file showing approximately how many words the novel has, and a table of contents listing the numbered chapter headings.
